# BooksApp
### 🚧 Refactoring in progress 👷‍♀️⛏👷🔧️👷🔧 🚧

the application works in two modes:

-> connected mode: retrieve the list from the webservice directly according to input parameters such as paging parameters (maximum number of results, start index), sorting parameters (relevance, newest),  mark a book in the favorite list

-> offline mode: the application allows you to display in this case the last list retrieved in online mode.

In this project I've used kotlin, MVVM, livedata, Room, Files, SharedPreferences, Coroutines, Retrofite, Glide, DataBinding, Androidx, Navigation Component Dagger 2 , mockito and unit tests.
